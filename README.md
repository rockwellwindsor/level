# Leveler

Leveler is a simple little bit of Jquery code that helps set matching height on elements.

---

## Dependencies

* Jquery - Reference it in the document.  Any path could be used so if the jQuery files are local, or you need a different version, just adjust the path to fit.
````shell
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.min.js"></script>
````

## Setup

To use leveler just copy the `levler.js` file into your javascript files directory.  Make sure you reference it after JQuery.

## Usage

Using leveler is easy.  Add the class `level` to the elements you want to level out.
